# primeNumbersWithJava
# This is/was a short project for my AP Comp-Sci class. 
Fairly inefficient but it gets it done, as im fairly new to java and im more experienced with JS.

As such this code is quite slow for huge numbers, as it took 28 minutes to calculate all primes between 1 and 1 Million and was off by about 168 Numbers (some how).
